# Task 8 — Create help center PR

Create a pull request for Help center markdown updates in `TW-Knowledge-bases-markdown`.

## Steps

1. Read the issue to identify the issue key (e.g. `OTW-1234`).
2. Use the markdown knowledge base repo:
   - `c:\Users\RichardBeer\Repos\TW-Knowledge-bases-markdown`
3. Ensure the branch exists and is up to date with remote:

   ```
   cd c:\Users\RichardBeer\Repos\TW-Knowledge-bases-markdown
   git checkout <issue_key>
   git pull
   ```

4. List changed markdown files against `master`:

   ```
   git diff --name-only master...<issue_key>
   ```

5. Create a pull request targeting `master`:
   - **Title:** `<issue_key>: Help center updates`
   - **Body:** A list of modified and created `.md` files from the diff output. If any new
     articles were created, note that they may need TOC entries added manually.
