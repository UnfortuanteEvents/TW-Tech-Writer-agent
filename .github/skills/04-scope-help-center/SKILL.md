# Task 4 — Scope help center

Using the pre-written UX change summary, identify what help center changes are required
for this issue.

## Starting point

Read the `### UX change summary (detailed)` section from the issue description. If this
task is running on a child issue, read it from the parent issue description instead.

This section, written in Task 3, is the authoritative list of UI changes for this issue.
Do not re-examine sources to determine what changed.

If the issue description does not contain a `### UX change summary (detailed)` section,
note this in the Scope table rationale and proceed using the available issue context.

## Stage 1 — Targeted article review

Determine whether the relevant knowledge base is Core or Omni (or both) based on the
product context.

The knowledge base articles are markdown files in the `TW-Knowledge-bases-markdown` repo:

- **Omni:** `Omni/*.md`
- **Core:** `Core/*.md`

Open the appropriate TOC file to identify the relevant subtopics:

- **Omni:** `Omni/_Metadata/TOC.md`
- **Core:** `Core/_Metadata/TOC.md`

The TOC is a markdown hierarchy where `##` headings represent topics, `###` headings
represent subtopics, and bullet items under subtopics represent article titles. Updates
typically affect subtopics within a topic, not entire topics.

For integration-related issues, note that integration help follows a hub-and-spoke
pattern: one main overview article branching to support articles, with optional
second-level overviews for larger integrations.

Read the articles within the relevant subtopics. For each article, determine whether it
needs to be:

- **Deleted** — the article is made obsolete by the update
- **Updated** — the article references UX elements, microcopy, or processes that are
  changing
- **Created** — the update introduces new functionality that requires a new article

Provide a rationale for each proposed change.

## Stage 2 — Broad KB sweep

Search across all articles in the relevant knowledge base markdown folder (`Core/` or
`Omni/`) for:

- References to microcopy that is changing
- References to UI elements that are being added, changed, or removed
- References to processes or workflows that are changing
- Opportunities to link to or contextually surface the feature (in a use-case sense, not
  promotional)

Report any additional articles found that were not already identified in Stage 2.

## Output

Add a new section to the issue description:

```
### Scope

| Article | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary updates** | | |
| [Article title] | [Delete/Update/Create] | [Why] |
| ... | | |
| **Secondary updates** | | |
| [Article title] | [Delete/Update/Create] | [Why] |
| ... | | |
```

Primary updates are articles within the most relevant subtopics (Stage 1). Secondary
updates are articles found in the broad KB sweep (Stage 2).
